While setting up a new web3 project from scratch, you might face multiple issues with the bundler. This issue is caused because the core packages like
`eccrypto` have certain dependencies, which are not present within the build environment. For rectifying this, the go-to method has been to just add
the missing modules directly into the package, and edit the bundler configuration to take advantage of that.

Although this method works, it increases the bundle size significantly. Causing slow loading speeds and a bad user experience. It is important to note
that these modules, even while the build fails, are still present within the browser environment. Many libraries like Web3Auth are written in a way to
take advantage of this fact. Hence, even if the build doesn't contain the polyfill, the library should still work as expected. However, if you are
using a library that does not take advantage of this fact, you might face issues while using the library.

Hence, you need to be mindful of the fact that you only require certain node polyfills to be added to your project, while testing each of its
functionalities. At the same time, you need to tell the bundler to ignore the missing modules, and not include them in the build.

In this guide, we have added instructions for adding the polyfills in React Native Metro.

## Install the missing modules

Check for the missing libraries in your build and included packages, and accordingly polyfill them. For Web3Auth, you need to polyfill the `buffer`,
`process`, `crypto` and `stream` libraries. For the rest of the libraries, we are installing a dummy module called `empty-module` which helps us get
rid of the warnings while building the project.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save empty-module readable-stream crypto-browserify react-native-get-random-values buffer process
```

:::warning

There might be a possibility that you might need to polyfill more libraries, in case you're using any other blockchain library alongside Web3Auth that
requires them. Generally, the libraries like `browserify-zlib`, `assert`, `stream-http`, `https-browserify`, `os-browserify`, `url` are the ones that
might be required.

:::

## Update your `metro.config.js`

To make use of the polyfilled modules while building the application, you need to reconfigure your metro bundler config.

:::info Expo Managed Workflow

You will have to create `metro.config.js` for Expo Managed Workflow, as it is not present by default. Also, note that polyfilling is not supported
with "Expo Go" app. It is compatible only with Custom Dev Client and EAS builds.

Please run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code based on the version of expo a project has installed, before moving forward.

:::

You can copy the following code in your `metro.config.js` file. This will tell the bundler to ignore the missing modules and include the ones that are
needed.

## Fixing additional dependency issues

- Create a `globals.js` to your project root directory and add the following code to it.

  ```tsx title="globals.js"
  global.Buffer = require("buffer").Buffer;

  // Needed so that 'stream-http' chooses the right default protocol.
  global.location = {
    protocol: "file:",
  };

  global.process.version = "v16.0.0";
  if (!global.process.version) {
    global.process = require("process");
    console.log({ process: global.process });
  }

  process.browser = true;
  ```

- Then, import the dependencies to `index.js` of your project.

  ```tsx title="index.js"
  import { AppRegistry } from "react-native";
  import "./globals";
  import "react-native-get-random-values";
  import App from "./App";
  import { name as appName } from "./app.json";
  AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
  ```
