:::warning

Web3Auth SDKs are not compatible with "Expo Go" app. They are compatible only with Custom Dev Client and EAS builds. Please refer to the
troubleshooting section for more on this.

Please run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code based on the version of expo a project has installed, before moving forward.
